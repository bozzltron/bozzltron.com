Is it still possible for a white kids to grow up believing racism is over?   

<!-- more -->

I grew up in a small rural Iowa town.  No diversity.  Not a single person of color living in that community.  Racism was not an experience as there was only a single race represented.  White. These circumstances can lead one to believe that the United States is a post-racial society.  That racism is over.  It is a thing of the past that we read about in our American History studies.  

My experience of people of color was on TV or in the city.  On TV, it reinforced the post-racial narrative seeing successful African-American atheletes, actors, and leaders.  In the city, it was only seeing people of color in passing.  Without a relationship there is know conduit to hear there story.  I had no platform where a voice of color could speak and undermind the post-racial narrative that I had accepted.

As a white man ignorantly enjoying a dominately cultural position, it takes time for the lie to be undone.  Privilege is blinding.  Little by litte as I have traveled, read, experienced, and listened, its unraveling.  While I've come along way, I still have a long way to go.  It has me wondering: Is it still possible for a kid to grow up believing racism is over.  It has to be in the United States.  The 2016 census shows the US is still 72% white.  There has to be more communities like mine.

My hope is that cultural tidal wave that was triggered by the death of George Flyod and so many others breaks the spell for others much earlier in life than me.  As much I hope for a platform to black voices to reach white communities I realize I play a role.  I am part of the platform, not speaking on behalf of black voices, but doing my best to propogate those voices.
