Not to exposed, not too cheap, but just right.

## The Right Case
The Raspberry Pi camera module is pretty striped down.  It doesn't come in its own case.  My first case was a simple plastic around the camera lens.

The second case was 3D printed to have an adjustable arm.  While its great that the model was free, the arm didn't have the stability that I needed.

Finally, I buckled down and purchased a case that not only had a solid enclosure for both the Raspberry Pi but also the camera module.  The back of the case had a standard tripod mount, so I got a mount that had bendable legs.
