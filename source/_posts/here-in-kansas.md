>The sun shines spotty and the stream is calling here in Kansas.

For my second annual week of seclusion, I wanted to go someplace different. My guiding criteria was to trim down the 7-hour drive that I took the previous year. I found an "artists" cabin in Kansas.  Since songwriting was one of my intentions, I was sold.

I started down listening to a bunch of [song exploder podcasts](https://songexploder.net/) to get into a creative mindset.  I felt like I had many ideas going. It was getting me in the right headspace.

My arrival was met with slight discouragement. The cabin was visible to the host's home.  Something more secluded was the ideal.  On a positive note, the structure was a tiny home complete with a quirky host to match.  She noticed my unpacking and gave some instructions from afar.   She wore a hat that gave her fox-like ears and had flaps that covered her cheeks.

Getting in required opening a fence and led to a bridge over a creek.  The fence held a horse and pony.  The cabin came with surprises.  I crossed over into in the covered porch and through door.  It had been augmented over the years with a bunch of different DIY homemaking materials and techniques. Down below were a fully functional kitchen, shower, and a little cove to sleep. Up top was for kids to sleep and play. Out towards the front was a sitting and reading space.

Once I got everything inside, I immediately picked up my guitar and started writing.  I observed my environment and channeled that into the content. What rang loud to me was the sound of the water outside, the wildlife, and the cabin.  It was the sound of spring.  I was practicing a technique I had learned from another writer. To listen to the world like you're listening to a record. It was symphonic. That became the central theme of the song.

As the lyrics progressed, they got more personal.  Being alone has this way of reminding you who means the most.  As Jeff Tweedy says, "Distance has a way of making love understandable."  I was thoroughly enjoying the moment and wanted to share it with another.  That other was my wife.

## Lyrics

>Verse 1
>The sun shines spotty
>and the stream is calling
>Here in kansas
>
>I put a fire in the stove
>and unpack all that I brought
>
>The wet earth walks soft
>and the cardinals talk
>Here in kansas
> 
>Paper to pen giving everything I got
>Giving everything I got
>
>Chorus
>Spring seems like a symphony
>I'm just joining in
>to all it's got to say
>are you listening ?
>The sound builds like an avalanche
>busting through the trees
>filling my  heart again
>and I'm remembering
>All I have is memory
>
>Verse 2
>The rains turn loose
>but I'm warm in my shoes
>Here in kansas
>
>Pages turn easy
>As I'm getting out of my head
>
>The spider strings silently
>Building it's web
>Here in kansas
>
>I watch her work quiet
>as my body finds its bed
>As my body finds its bed
