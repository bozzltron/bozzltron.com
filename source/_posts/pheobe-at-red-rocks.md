A favorite artist in a coveted venue and a profound connection.

The drive up north along the mountains to the west was absolutely beautiful. Red rocks being a gorgeous preservation of what nature can be. Even the parking lot was beautiful.

Donis and I took a short walk through the park to explore for a bit and then enter the venue.  We provided our proof of vaccinations, waited in line for a bit, and found our seats. 

The opening act was provocative and the venue was everything I had hoped it to be. The moment came for the main act. It was hilarious to see the band come out to a track from Disturbed. A good candidate for the antithesis of her music.

Each song was like a painting. The background visuals changed as well as the soundscapes. It was quite the contrast to listen to such soft melancholy music in such a gigantic venue, which seemed to call for arena rock bands smashing drums and spitting blood.

Sometimes there is music that resonates with your circumstances. The COVID experience is many things to many people and I know I'm not alone in that experience invoking a reevaluation of life. I felt stuck in Iowa. I was ready for a fresh start elsewhere. A new adventure. Phoebe's music amplified that feeling. Specifically the song Halloween. The lyrics saying "baby it's Halloween, we can be anything" to me we're an anthem about freedom, self-expression, and making yourself. I wanted that freedom and we made the move. A rushed, last minute, move to Colorado Springs.

Now fast forward almost a year and I've made the move and now I'm sitting in this venue that I've always wanted to visit watching that very artist perform the song. It was surreal. The prophecy was fulfilled.

Even crazier is that Phoebe performed a new hit single called Sidelines. Like every other song the background changed to give the soundscape a visual theme. The song took on the theme of a rodeo with horses and cowboys and gates in the background. Donis pointed out to me in the background she saw the word Austin. This is exactly where she and I were looking to move that summer. Again the music and now the performance associated with it seemed to provide direction in the moment that I needed it.


I do recognize that you have to be careful with things like this. It's often true that we see what we want to see. For me it makes for a better more romantic story. And I like it. It's Halloween.
