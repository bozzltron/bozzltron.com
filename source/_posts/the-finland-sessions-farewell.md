What was it like to spend time in isolation broken free from my normal routine to process life and make music?  It was healing.

Stillness,  quiet, natural beauty, and creating recharge me.  The location could not have been more perfect. It was intimidating flying solo into the wilderness, but I adjusted.  The same area in the summer would be amazing for hiking.

Cooking in the cabin took some planning, but was enjoyable.  I'll be better prepared next time.

The writing seemed natural. I tried following ideas as they came.  I let go of trying to prove myself or writing to impress someone and just had fun.

The recording was a blast because I got to work with the environment.  The natural reverb of the room.  The sound of the river.  The sound of stomping on the wood floor.   The space left its mark on each song.

The time I had to look at life from a different vantage point.  To get a grasp on where things lay and to start anticipating what is to come gave me vision.

This is something I'd like to do annually.  It took discipline to stay all four days.  I wrestled with guilt for being away from family.  Routine has gravity.  It's a fight to truly break away, but it's part of what I need to do to stay on top of perspective and not just let life happen to me.

The gift I walked away with was gratitude for life, family, and everything else.  If that's all that I ever gain, it's worth the drive.
