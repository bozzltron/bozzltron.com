Sometimes a dream is just as inspiring as its corresponding reality. I was so excited to have my first vision quest in the wilderness of Minnesota that I wrote a song in advance.

I'm a 90's kid.  Grunge, Alternative, and mainstream Punk all thrown in a pot and brought to a boil.  It's foundational.  Weezer's Blue Album, Green Day's Dookie, Soundgarden's Superunknown, Silverchair's Frogstomp, Smashing Pumpkin's Siamese Dream, and Nirvana's In Utero are not just great albums but inform my creations.

*Letting Go* comes from some of that.  It's a song that captures my eagerness to break away, seek release, have an outlet, and get it all out.

## Lyrics

>I've been scratching
>For some space
>To get my head
>On the page
>
>There's only so much
>That I can fit
>Inside my head
>Before it splits
>
>Chorus
>Feel the pressure
>building up
>Gotta get away
>before I blow
>
>Knock the arrow
>Bend the bow
>Feather to my cheek
>I'm letting go
>
>Verse 2
>I've been Itching
>For a place
>To get my head
>On the page
>
>There's only so much
>I can take
>Before bending
>Before I break
