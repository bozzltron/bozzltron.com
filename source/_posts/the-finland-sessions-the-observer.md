On a still morning in a remote cabin north of Lake Superior, I woke up to something new.  The time, space, and the tools to create music.

I rolled out of the upstairs loft, creaked down the steep wooden stairs, and made breakfast and coffee looking out through a long rectangular window out across a shallow river valley.  It was completely covered with tall pine trees and a 20-inch snow base.  I took my breakfast to the living area and threw out some suet for the birds to munch.  

Sitting for a while, watching the world, and listening to the sound of the river, I picked up my guitar and starting writing *The Observer*.  All of the lyrics came out of what was unfolding on a beautiful mountain morning in Finland, Minnesota.  The song is trying to take you, the listener, to that cabin morning to experience it.  In the background is a recording of the river.

## Lyrics
>The sun is rising
>The snow is falling
>The world is waking
>I'm just watching
>
>The trees are reaching
>The rivers flowing
>My worries fading
>Time is slowing
>
>The trail is calling
>The birds are feeding
>My soul is singing
>I'm just breathing
>
>The forests growing
>The snow is glistenin'
>My heart is swelling
>I'm just listenin'
