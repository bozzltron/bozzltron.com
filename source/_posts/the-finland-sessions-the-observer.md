On a still morning in a remote cabin north of Lake Superior, I woke up to something new.  The the time, the space, and the tools to just create music.

I rolled out of the upstairs loft, creeked down the steep wooden stairs, and made breakfast and coffee looking out through a long rectangular window out across a shallow river valley.  The valley us completely surrounded in pines.  At the time there was around a 20 inch snow base.  I took my breakfast to the living area and threw out some suet for the birds to munch.  

I sat for awhile, watched the world, and listened to the sound of the river.  I picked up my guitar and starting writing *The Observer*.  All of the lyrics came out of what I was watching unfold on a beautiful mountain morning.  The song is trying to take you the listener to that cabin morning so you can experience it yourself.  I recorded the sound of the river and put it in the background of the recording.
