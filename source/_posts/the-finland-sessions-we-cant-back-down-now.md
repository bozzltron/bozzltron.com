Taking time to step out of a routine and put life on paper to weigh its purpose and intentionality and measure its direction is something I do well.  I am a processor.

Looking back over 2019, it was a rough year for many reasons. It forced use to decide if we wanted to live in a world where we were part of the problem or part of the solution.  To leave the world better than how we found it.  2020 is no different.  It has broken me in the best way.  

This was what I was musing on when I picked up my guitar.  I wasn't anticipating writing *We Can't Back Down Now*.  It came to me.  I found some chords that seem to give voice to the strain in my soul.  I thought my wife and how much we've gone through together.  It was clear to me that this song was for her.  It was a message of encouragement that while we've struggled, we can still enjoying blessing and see other blessed along the way.  These are healing words that came through welled up eyes.

## Lyrics
>This seasons been one poetic punch in our face
>Our souls bending under the weight
>When I see your eyes I know you feel the same
>
>And life is unrelenting
>Always feeling attacked
>Always a fight to unpack
>But you don't hold the blame
>
>Girl our ships not shinking
>We just gotta jettison the weight
>All this negative freight
>And set our sails
>
>And who am I ? Just another jerk off the street
>But I love you complete
>And I know we can't
>back down
>Back down
>We can't back down now
>
>Please forgive my ignorant place in this mess
>All of my fight I relent
>At least towards you
>
>But when it comes all of this weight that we bear
>I carry more than my share
>To see that you smile
>
>And know that this season will retreat like it came
>But until we see through the rain
>We can't back down
>We can't back down
>We can't back down now
