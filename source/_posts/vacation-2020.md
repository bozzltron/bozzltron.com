My family loves wilderness and narrative.

<!-- more -->

This is what I learned spending three days with my wife and kids living in a tent, cooking over the fire, far from the distractions of our regular routine.  

We found a nest of Black Widows, played with Daddy long legs, heard wild life in the night, and for all of these experience my kids crafts contextual stories around them.  They gave animals names and made up stories as what they were up to.

Most of our time was just exploring.  We found a water hole, a freezing cold stream, and the kids loved it.  It was our our secret place to just be.  A much needed break from screens and people.
